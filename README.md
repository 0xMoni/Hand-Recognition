# Hand-Recognition  

A simple hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand signs like thumbs up, thumbs down, peace, and OK signs.  

## Features  
- Detects common hand gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe  
- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition  
- Can be extended for more complex gestures, including sign language detection  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)  
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)  
- NumPy (`numpy`)
  
## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xMoni/Hand-Recognition.git
   cd Hand-Recognition
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python hand_recognition.py
   ```  

## Future Scope  
Currently, this code detects basic hand gestures using emojis. However, it can be extended in the future to recognize sign language, making it more useful for communication and accessibility purposes.
